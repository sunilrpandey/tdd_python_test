# Module 1: TDD Basics

This module introduces Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles using a simple example.

## What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where you:
1. Write a test that fails (Red)
2. Write the minimum code to make the test pass (Green)
3. Refactor the code while keeping the tests passing (Refactor)

## Example: Calculator Class
We'll implement a simple calculator class using TDD. Follow the commits to see how the implementation evolves through the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

## Files in this Module
- `calculator.py`: The main implementation
- `test_calculator.py`: The test file
- `README.md`: This file with instructions

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand the TDD workflow
2. Practice the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
3. Learn about test-first development
4. Understand the benefits of TDD

## Exercise
1. Follow the commits to see how the Calculator class evolves
2. Try adding new features using TDD:
   - Multiplication
   - Division
   - Power function
   
Remember to always write the test first!
