# Module 6: System Testing and IO

This module demonstrates pytest features for testing system interactions, file operations, and output capturing.

## Features Covered

### 1. Output Capturing (capsys)
- Capture stdout and stderr
- Testing print statements
- Logging verification

### 2. Temporary Files and Directories
- `tmp_path` fixture
- File operations testing
- Cleanup handling

### 3. Warning Testing
- Warning capture and verification
- Custom warning testing
- Warning filters

### 4. Environment Variables
- Testing with environment variables
- Mocking environment
- Cleanup and restoration

## Files in this Module
- `file_processor.py`: File operations example
- `logger.py`: Logging and output example
- `test_file_processor.py`: Tests for file operations
- `test_logger.py`: Tests for output capturing
- `README.md`: This file with instructions

## Learning Objectives
1. Master output capturing
2. Handle temporary files safely
3. Test warnings and logging
4. Manage environment variables

## Exercise
1. Run the provided tests
2. Add new test cases for different outputs
3. Create tests with temporary files
4. Test warning scenarios
